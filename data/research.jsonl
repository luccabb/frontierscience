{"problem":"Context: Weak value amplification is an enhanced detection scheme that was first suggested by Aharonov, Albert, and Vaidman \\[1\\]. (See \\[2\\] and \\[3\\] for recent reviews.) The scheme exploits the fact that postselecting the weak measurement of an ancilla can produce a linear detector response with an anomalously high sensitivity to small changes in an interaction parameter. The sensitivity arises from coherent “super-oscillatory” interference in the ancilla, which is controlled by the choice of preparation and postselection of the ancilla. The price that one pays for this increase in sensitivity is a reduction in the potential signal (and thus the potential precision of any estimation) due to the postselection process. Nevertheless, by using this technique one can still consistently recover a large fraction of the maximum obtainable signal in a relatively simple way. The relevant information is effectively concentrated into the small set of rarely postselected events.\n\nSome recent experiments have reported precision near the standard quantum limit. These observations have prompted the question of whether the amplification technique can be improved further by combining it with other metrology techniques. One such improvement that has been proposed is to recycle the events that were discarded by the postselection back into the measurement. Another investigation has shown that in certain cases it may even be possible to achieve precision near the optimal Heisenberg limit using seemingly classical resources.\n\nHere, we supplement these efforts by asking whether adding quantum resources to the weak value amplification procedure can also improve the efficiency of the technique.\n\n1.

This production is expected to last several tens of seconds and to carry detailed information on the mechanisms and dynamics of the collapse process.\n\nSince that first observation, several experiments have searched in real time for other galactic supernovae using liquid scintillator (Asakura et al. 2016; Bruno et al. 2017; Monzani 2006), plastic scintillator (Ambrosio et al. 1998), lead (Zuber 2015), heavy-water (Aharmim et al. 2011), and water-based detectors (Abe et al. 2016a; Kopke 2018).

{"problem":"Context: Generalized (or weakened) quantum measurements introduce qualitatively new features in fundamental quantum physics that do not appear with simple projective measurements. Moreover, sequences of weak measurements can be made effectively continuous, resulting in quantum state evolutions described by quantum stochastic processes. Crucially, continuous quantum monitoring makes feedback control feasible, allowing parameters in the system Hamiltonian to be dynamically adjusted based on measurement outcomes.\n\nIn classical stochastic systems, an important class of problems involves rare-event physics, specifically processes characterized by unlikely transitions that start and end at specific points in phase space. In classical contexts, these rare events can be analyzed by introducing a canonical phase space formulation and identifying optimal paths by minimizing a suitable action functional under specified boundary conditions.\n\nA comparable situation emerges in continuously measured quantum systems, where one seeks to prepare an initial quantum state and later observes a rare final (postselected) state at a specified time.\n\nHere, we would like to develop a stochastic path integral formulation of continuous quantum measurements, deriving an action principle that naturally incorporates boundary conditions such as postselection. This formulation complements and generalizes the known stochastic Schrödinger or master equation approaches, recovering them as special cases when postselection is absent.\n\nPath-integral treatments of continuous quantum measurement have a long history, notably including Mensky's work on restricted Feynman path integrals from over three decades ago. Our approach differs fundamentally from previous formulations by constructing a probability distribution for trajectories through a canonically doubled (potentially mixed) quantum state space.\n\nBy doubling the state space to form a canonical quantum phase space, we can extremize the resulting stochastic action. This procedure identifies the most probable trajectories connecting specified preselected and postselected states. As a paradigmatic demonstration, we would like to apply our formalism to continuously monitored solid-state qubits, identifying their most likely dynamics in both quantum demolition and non-demolition measurement regimes. We also aim to further characterize rare quantum jump events occurring within the quantum Zeno regime.\nQuestion: The objective is to develop a stochastic path integral framework for continuous quantum measurement, enabling the derivation of an action principle suitable for analyzing rare quantum events with defined boundary conditions, such as preselected and postselected states.

{"problem":"Context: Generalized (or weakened) quantum measurements introduce qualitatively new features in fundamental quantum physics that do not appear with simple projective measurements. Moreover, sequences of weak measurements can be made effectively continuous, resulting in quantum state evolutions described by quantum stochastic processes. Crucially, continuous quantum monitoring makes feedback control feasible, allowing parameters in the system Hamiltonian to be dynamically adjusted based on measurement outcomes.\n\nIn classical stochastic systems, an important class of problems involves rare-event physics, specifically processes characterized by unlikely transitions that start and end at specific points in phase space. In classical contexts, these rare events can be analyzed by introducing a canonical phase space formulation and identifying optimal paths by minimizing a suitable action functional under specified boundary conditions.\n\nA comparable situation emerges in continuously measured quantum systems, where one seeks to prepare an initial quantum state and later observes a rare final (postselected) state at a specified time.\n\nHere, we would like to develop a stochastic path integral formulation of continuous quantum measurements, deriving an action principle that naturally incorporates boundary conditions such as postselection. This formulation complements and generalizes the known stochastic Schrödinger or master equation approaches, recovering them as special cases when postselection is absent.\n\nPath-integral treatments of continuous quantum measurement have a long history, notably including Mensky's work on restricted Feynman path integrals from over three decades ago. Our approach differs fundamentally from previous formulations by constructing a probability distribution for trajectories through a canonically doubled (potentially mixed) quantum state space.\n\nBy doubling the state space to form a canonical quantum phase space, we can extremize the resulting stochastic action. This procedure identifies the most probable trajectories connecting specified preselected and postselected states. As a paradigmatic demonstration, we would like to apply our formalism to continuously monitored solid-state qubits, identifying their most likely dynamics in both quantum demolition and non-demolition measurement regimes. We also aim to further characterize rare quantum jump events occurring within the quantum Zeno regime.\nQuestion: The objective is to develop a stochastic path integral framework for continuous quantum measurement, enabling the derivation of an action principle suitable for analyzing rare quantum events with defined boundary conditions, such as preselected and postselected states. This method should generalize existing stochastic Schrödinger or master equation formulations, explicitly recovering them when no postselection is applied.\n\nSpecifically, the task should include:\n\n1. **Formulating** a stochastic path integral for continuous quantum measurements that explicitly incorporates postselection as boundary conditions.\n2. **Introducing** a canonical quantum phase space by doubling the quantum state space, allowing extremization of the associated stochastic action.\n3. **Identifying and characterizing** the optimal (most probable) trajectories connecting preselected and postselected quantum states through extremization of the stochastic action.

{"problem":"Context: The fabrication of high-efficiency GaAs solar cells relies on precise control over material composition, doping profiles, and layer architecture at the microscale. Unlike commercial off-the-shelf devices, lab-scale fabrication requires a carefully planned sequence of material deposition, removal, and modification steps to construct a well-defined p–n junction and supporting structures. At the core of this process is the formation of the n-type and p-type GaAs layers, which define the charge separation region critical to photovoltaic operation. These layers must be engineered with high crystalline quality, abrupt doping transitions, and optimal thickness to enable efficient carrier collection, minimal recombination, and good electrical contact.\n\nThis methodology outlines the fabrication sequence necessary to produce such a device, emphasizing the deposition and processing of the n-type and p-type GaAs layers.

{"problem":"Context: Dark matter makes up to 27% of the Universe's mass-energy budget, and it is plausible to describe this additional matter contribution in terms of a new fundamental particle. As such, there are now neutrino-based searches since neutrinos are neutral, stable on cosmological scales, and have a relic abundance that fits astronomical observations. The main candidates for neutrino-based searches are weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) that naturally display an interaction strength of the same order as the known electroweak interaction, and could therefore be a target for neutrino telescopes.\nQuestion: Flesh out a process to investigate indirect WIMP searches with neutrino telescopes, using as a concrete case WIMPs gravitationally captured in the Sun that annihilate (or decay) and produce neutrino fluxes predicted by current software (no need to mention specific software names). Supposedly neutrino telescopes, which are not originally designed for dark matter searches, are able to place competitive limits on WIMP mass and WIMP–nucleon scattering (especially spin-dependent); explain how this is possible in the solar WIMP scenario.

{"problem":"Context: IceCube neutrino scientists usually calculate confidence intervals on their results by constructing contours based on Wilks' Theorem. For time-integrated neutrino searches, the TS of the neutrino background generally follows Wilks' Theorem with two degrees of freedom. For time-dependent neutrino searches, the TS of the neutrino background generally follows Wilks' Theorem with four degrees of freedom. In order to calculate contours, we construct the variable \\( \\Delta \\)TS by scanning the likelihood space in two dimensions and then subtracting the scanned TS from the best-fit TS (\\( \\Delta \\)TS = TS\\( _{best-fit} \\) - TS\\( _{truth} \\)) and creating a 2D histogram of these values with the colorbar being \\( \\Delta \\)TS, the x-axis being dt, and the y-axis being ns. We would then determine the Wilks' contours from the \\( \\Delta \\)TS\n\nIf scientific data is filled with background or is bounded by physical conditions, it may be difficult to calculate limits or confidence intervals on such data. In this case, one can utilize the Feldman-Cousins method to ensure that the resulting intervals always cover the true value at the stated confidence level and avoid unphysical or empty intervals.\n\nSay I am running an experiment where I am investigating the AGN NGC 1068 to see if its neutrino flux seems to be flaring or if it seems to be coming from steady emission. This experiment utilizes the maximum likelihood method to find where, given the free parameters gamma (energy spectrum), ns (number of signal events), t0 (the mean time of a Gaussian flare in MJD), and dt (the 1-sigma Gaussian flare duration in days), the most likely combination of the four free parameters in parameter space is. The resulting 2D likelihood space of this data in just ns and dt seems to have a local minimum at small dt and a global minimum at the maximum allowable dt.\n\nI also have the ability to run \"trials\" or pseudo-experiments with my data by scrambling my dataset. I can run these trials as background trials by just scrambling my dataset, or I can run these trials as signal trials by scrambling my dataset and then injecting a specified number of signal events at a specified gamma, t0, and dt.\n\nI can also scan over my true dataset's likelihood space by seeing what the likelihood (expressed in terms of test statistic) is for a specific combination of parameters.\nQuestion: How would I set confidence intervals on the best-fit dt of the flare if the best-fit dt reaches the max allowed dt of 1960 days?\n\nSpecify which method (Wilks' or Feldman Cousins) should be used to calculate confidence intervals in this case and explain in detail why this was chosen over the other option.\n\nIf constructing trials, be specific in what parameter combinations should be used and how many combinations should be used. Also be specific in whether we should use background trials only, signal trials only, or both background and signal trials.\n\nFor the Feldman-Cousins method, outline exactly how you would construct a 2-D contour on the plot described by the context. Describe how you would construct the TS_best-fit values (minimizer or scan?) and the TS_truth values (for the truth, specify whether you should run a new fit or use the likelihood scan). Explain the construction of pseudo-trial `\\( \\Delta \\)TS` and the true data `\\( \\Delta \\)`TS separately. \n\nOnce you have the best-fit values and the truth values, describe how you would use them to find the 90% included contour of the 2D histogram.\n\nIf using `\\( \\Delta \\)`TS as your variable for the Feldman-Cousins method, explain in what circumstances (or parameter combinations) it is more likely to get positive `\\( \\Delta \\)`TS values in the pseudo-trials `\\( \\Delta \\)TS histogram` and in what circumstances it is more likely to get negative `\\( \\Delta \\)`TS values.\n\nSimilarly, why might our likelihood minimizer be contributing to `\\( \\Delta \\)TS that are not equal to 0?

To gain full points, the solution should show detailed workings as below. We are looking for a map ( T_W ) for which \\\\begin{equation} \\\\langle T_W(\\\\underbrace{\\\\Pi(X,\\\\dots,X}*{n \\\\text{ times}}, \\\\underbrace{P,\\\\dots,P}*{m \\\\text{ times}}))\\\\rangle = (\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda})^{(n+m)} \\\\langle \\\\underbrace{\\\\Pi(X,\\\\dots,X}*{n \\\\text{ times}}, \\\\underbrace{P,\\\\dots,P}*{m \\\\text{ times}})\\\\rangle. \\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\\n  where ( \\\\Pi(A_1, A_2, \\\\dots, A_n) = \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\sum\\_\\\\pi A\\_{\\\\pi(1)} A\\_{\\\\pi(2)} \\\\cdots A\\_{\\\\pi(n)} ) is the average of the products for each permutation ( \\\\pi ). These averages correspond to the expectation calculated through the Wigner function ( W(x,p) ):\\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\\n  \\\\langle \\\\underbrace{\\\\Pi(X,\\\\dots,X}*{n \\\\text{ times}}, \\\\underbrace{P,\\\\dots,P}*{m \\\\text{ times}})\\\\rangle = \\\\int_M x^n p^m W(x,p) , dx dp. \\\n  \\\\end{equation}. The map ( T_W ), then, would correspond to a pure stretching map on the Wigner function. However, this cannot work. Wigner functions can have regions with negative values, but the size of these regions cannot exceed a few units of ( \\\\hbar ). The size of these negative regions would increase under ( T_W ), giving functions that do not correspond to a quantum state. Therefore we cannot find a pure stretching map in the symmetrized average operator ordering.\n- **0.5pts**: The solution considers the normal ordering case associated to the Glauber-Sudarshan distribution and concludes that it cannot work. To gain full points, the solution should show detailed workings as below. \\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\\n  \\\\langle T_P((a^\\\\dagger)^n a^m)\\\\rangle = (\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda})^{(n+m)} \\\\langle (a^\\\\dagger)^n a^m \\\\rangle. \\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\\n  For the vacuum state we have ( a|0\\\\rangle = 0 ), which means the mean value of all observables in normal ordering for the vacuum is zero. These would remain unchanged by ( T_P ). The vacuum state, then, would not change and therefore the map would not increase entropy for all states. The normal ordering is ruled out as well.\n- **0.5pts**: The solution considers the anti-normal ordering case associated to the Husimi ( Q ) distribution and concludes that it is a potential candidate. To gain full points, the solution should show detailed workings as below. Anti-normal ordering and a map ( T_Q ) such that: \\\\begin{equation} \\\\langle T_Q(a^n (a^\\\\dagger)^m)\\\\rangle = (\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda})^{(n+m)} \\\\langle a^n (a^\\\\dagger)^m \\\\rangle. \\\\tag{21} \\\\end{equation} This ordering solves the previous problem of the vacuum. The anti-normal ordering is connected to the Husimi ( Q ) distribution by: \\\\begin{equation} \\\\langle a^n (a^\\\\dagger)^m \\\\rangle = \\\\int \\\\alpha^n (\\\\alpha^\\*)^m Q_1(\\\\alpha) , d^2\\\\alpha. \\\\tag{22} \\\\end{equation} The map ( T_Q ), then, corresponds to a pure stretching map on the space where ( Q ) is defined. That is, \\\\begin{equation} T_Q(Q_1(\\\\alpha)) \\\\equiv Q\\_\\\\lambda(\\\\alpha) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} Q_1\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}}\\\\right).  \\\\end{equation}. We indicate ( Q_1 ) as the initial unstretched distribution and ( Q\\_\\\\lambda ) the final stretched distribution by a factor of ( \\\\lambda ). We can in fact verify that:\\\n  \\\\begin{equation}\\\n  \\\\int \\\\alpha^n (\\\\alpha^*)^m Q\\_\\\\lambda(\\\\alpha) , d^2\\\\alpha = \\\\int \\\\alpha^n (\\\\alpha^*)^m \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda} Q_1\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}}\\\\right) , d^2\\\\alpha = \\\\int \\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}^{n+m} \\\\beta^n (\\\\beta^\\*)^m Q_1(\\\\beta) , d^2\\\\beta. \\\\tag{24}\\\n  \\\\end{equation}\\\n  Since the Husimi distribution is non-negative, this avoids the issue presented by the Wigner function. The anti-normal ordering, then, is a potential candidate. \\\n  \\\n  \\\n  Context for this rubric item. \\\n  \\\n  We are looking for a map that rescales the expectations of the polynomials for a particular ordering. There are three commonly used orderings: symmetrized averages, normal ordering and anti-normal ordering. The first takes the product of ( n ) operators by averaging all possible permutations; the second is in terms of polynomials of the form ((a^\\\\dagger)^n a^m), where ( a = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{m\\\\omega}{2\\\\hbar}}\\\\left(X + \\\\frac{i}{m\\\\omega}P\\\\right) ) and ( a^\\\\dagger ) are the ladder operators, ( m ) is the mass and ( \\\\omega ) the angular frequency; the last is in terms of ( a^n(a^\\\\dagger)^m ). The three orderings are associated, respectively, with a quasi-probability distribution: the Wigner function ( W ), the Glauber-Sudarshan ( P ) distribution and the Husimi ( Q ) distribution. In each case, the expectation under the quasi-probability distribution of polynomials of classical variables returns the expectation of the respective ordering.\n\n  Interestingly, not all orderings will allow a pure stretching map ( T ) that rescales all expectations and increases the entropy of all states.\nPoints: 0.625, Item: One of the advantages of this approach is that it is compatible with more traditional ones. Here, the solution should examine the failure of classical statistical mechanics to predict black-body radiation. Assign points as follows: \n\n- **0.125pts**: The spectrum predicted by classical mechanics is given by the Rayleigh–Jeans law, \\\\begin{equation} \\\\frac{2 \\\\nu^2 k_B T}{c^2} = \\\\frac{2 \\\\nu^2}{c^2 \\\\beta}, \\\\quad \\\\beta = \\\\frac{1}{k_B T}. \\\\end{equation}\n- **0.125pts**: The one predicted by quantum mechanics is given by Planck's law, \\\\begin{equation} \\\\frac{2 h \\\\nu^3}{c^2} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{h \\\\nu}{k_B T}\\\\right) - 1} = \\\\frac{2 h \\\\nu^3}{c^2} \\\\frac{1}{e^{h \\\\beta \\\\nu} - 1}. \\\\end{equation}\n- **0.125pts**: It is well known that the two agree for small values of $\\\\nu$ since $e^x \\\\approx 1 + x + O(x^2)$ for $x \\\\ll 1$: \\\\begin{equation} \\\\frac{2 h \\\\nu^3}{c^2} \\\\frac{1}{e^{h \\\\beta \\\\nu} - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2 h \\\\nu^3}{c^2} \\\\frac{1}{1 + h \\\\beta \\\\nu + O(\\\\nu^2) - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2 \\\\nu^2}{c^2 \\\\beta}. \\\\end{equation}\n- **0.25pts**: The solution notes that the same result can be achieved by taking the limit for large temperatures, i.e., the classical black-body radiation spectrum can also be understood as the first term in the expansion for small $\\\\beta$: \\\\begin{equation} \\\\frac{2 h \\\\nu^3}{c^2} \\\\frac{1}{e^{h \\\\beta \\\\nu} - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2 h \\\\nu^3}{c^2} \\\\frac{1}{1 + h \\\\beta \\\\nu + O(\\\\beta^2) - 1} \\\\approx \\\\frac{2 \\\\nu^2}{c^2 \\\\beta}. \\\\end{equation}. Since $\\\\beta$ is the inverse of the temperature, this is the limit for large temperatures. Since the entropy increases as the temperature increases, this is also the limit for large entropy. That is, the classical distribution is recovered as the high-entropy limit for the quantum distribution.\nPoints: 0.75, Item: Provides another qualitative argument that shows the link between high entropy and classical mechanics comes from the relationship between entropy and uncertainty for a single degree of freedom. Assign points as follows:\n\n- **0.125pts**: Writes down the the relationship between entropy and uncertainty for Gaussian states in classical mechanics as \\\\begin{equation} S_C(\\\\Sigma) = \\\\ln\\\\left( 2 \\\\pi e \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma}{\\\\hbar} \\\\right) = \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma}{\\\\hbar} \\\\right) + 1. \\\\end{equation}.\n\n  The expression should be an exact match to be awarded points.\n\n- **0.125pts**: Writes down the the relationship between entropy and uncertainty for Gaussian states in quantum mechanics as\\\n  \\\\\\[ S_Q(\\\\Sigma) = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma}{\\\\hbar} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma}{\\\\hbar} + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma}{\\\\hbar} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right) \\\\ln\\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\Sigma}{\\\\hbar} - \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\right). \\\\\\]\n\n  The expression should be an exact match to be awarded points.\n\n- **0.5pts**: Comments and compres the two equations.\n\n  - **(0.125pts)** Mentions that the classical and quantum cases are very close even when the uncertainty is just a few units of \\\\(\\\\hbar\\\\).\n  - **(0.125pts)** These diverge at about two units of \\\\(\\\\hbar\\\\): in quantum mechanics, the entropy decreases faster and reaches zero at \\\\(\\\\hbar \/ 2\\\\), the bound for the Heisenberg uncertainty principle; classical mechanics reaches zero entropy for \\\\(\\\\hbar \/ e\\\\), and then continues in the negative region.\n  - **(0.25pts)** The convergent prediction at high entropy together with the divergent prediction at low entropy, and the negative values for the classical case, reinforces the idea that quantum mechanics is required at low entropy, much like relativity is required at high speeds.\nPoints: 1.125, Item: Qualitatively discuss examples that support the statement that quantum mechanics is the low-entropy limit of classical mechanics. Points should be awarded as follows:\n\n- **0.125pts**: Recognises that coherence is probably one of the direct and most important properties of a quantum system. However, it is quickly lost through interaction with the environment, through decoherence. Since decoherence increases the entropy of the system, it represents one mechanism to reach the high-entropy limit. This is in line with the statement.\n- **0.5pts**: Assign 0.1pts for each quantum effect mentioned (e.g. superconductivity, topological insulators, quantum Hall effect), up to 0.3pts. Assign the remaining 0.2pts if the answer mentions that it is harder or impossible to achieve these quantum effects at high temperature because the thermal noise can break the coherence of the system. Note that entropy is a monotonic function of temperature, meaning that decreasing temperature means decreasing entropy of the system. This is in line with the statement.\n- **0.125pts**: Mentions that some quantum effects can be replicated at high temperature given a high pressure (in apparent contraddiction to the statement). This is the case, for example, in some superconductive materials. However, the solution should recognise that high pressure corresponds to low entropy, which is in line with the statemnt. Along the same lines, white dwarfs and neutron stars exhibit quantum effects at high pressure, despite high temperatures.\n- **0.125pts**: Discusses Bose--Einstein condensates, where one needs a high density in phase space, which means both high spatial density (to decrease the position spread) and low temperature (to decrease the momentum spread). The phase space density (PSD) is directly related to entropy and dimensionality, as exemplified by the famous Sackur--Tetrode equation for the entropy of the ideal gas. This, again, is in line with the statement.\n- **0.125pts**: For thermodynamic systems in equilibrium, entropy can be calculated directly based on occupation of the quantum states of the system. For high temperatures, the occupations are all small and classical statistical mechanics applies. Quantum effects related to indistinguishability are found whenever occupations approach unity. The entropy per particle drops in the same limit, again in line with the result.\n- **0.125pts**: Notes that, while infinite entropy corresponds to infinite temperature, the reverse is not necessarily true. In systems with finitely many possible states we can find the stationary point of \\\\(S\\\\) as a function of \\\\(E\\\\) for which \\\\(1\/T = \\\\partial S\/\\\\partial E = 0\\\\). This stationary point represents the maximum entropy reachable by the system, and therefore there is no high entropy limit. This is exactly the case where temperature can have negative values. Given that entropy is a concave function of the energy, systems that admit a classical description are exactly those for which no such stationary point exists and temperature cannot be negative or infinite.\nPoints: 1.25, Item: The solution should describe the transformation of the Wigner function ( W ) under a pure quantum stretching map, the emergence of classical behavior, and the disappearance of negative regions as entropy (or (\\\\lambda)) grows large.\n\n- **0.25 pts**:\\\n  The solution should clearly state the relationship between the Wigner (W) and the (Q) distribution, showing that (Q) is the Weierstrass transform of (W).\n\n- **0.25 pts**: \\\n  The solution should correctly derive and interpret the scaled convolution formulas:\n  \\[\n  Q\\_\\\\lambda(\\\\alpha) = (W\\_\\\\lambda \\\\ast G)(\\\\alpha) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}(W_1 \\\\ast G)\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda}}\\\\right),\n  \\]\n  demonstrating how scaling by (\\\\lambda) affects the Wigner function.\n\n- **0.25 pts**: \\\n  The solution must show the use of the Fourier transform to establish scaling relations and derive:\n  \\[\n  W\\_\\\\lambda(\\\\beta) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda(\\\\lambda - 1)} W_1\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda - 1}}\\\\right) \\\\ast G\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\sqrt{\\\\lambda - 1}}\\\\right).\n  \\]\n\n- **0.25 pts**: \\\n  The solution should explain that as (\\\\lambda \\\\to \\\\infty), the Wigner function (W\\_\\\\lambda) becomes indistinguishable from the (Q\\_\\\\lambda) distribution.

The solution should show that expanding in powers of $\\\\beta$, the quantum corrections are also only found at second order in $\\\\beta$, justifying the classical limit. \n  - **(0.25pts)**: The solution should find the first-order expansion:\\\n    \\\\begin{equation}\\\n    e^{-\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}} \\\\approx 1 - \\\\beta (\\\\epsilon + \\\\hat{Q}),\\\n    \\\\end{equation}\\\n    where $\\\\epsilon$ is the classical Hamiltonian and $\\\\hat{Q}$ represents the quantum corrections.

The resulting precipitant (PLS-COOH) was pelleted by centrifugation, washed several times with water, and lyophilized (890 mg yield). PLS-COOH (800 mg, 3.51 mmol acid) and FTC (174 mg, 0.702 mmol) were weighed and added to an oven-dried 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with stir bar.

{"problem":"Context: Telomeres, protective DNA-protein complexes at chromosome ends, are critical for genomic stability. In cancer, replicative telomere shortening drives chromosomal instability, prompting malignant cells to reactivate telomere maintenance mechanisms (TMMs), primarily through telomerase (via TERT expression) or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). TERT dysregulation—via promoter mutations (e.g., C228T\/C250T), epigenetic modifications, or amplifications—is a hallmark of many cancers. Studying telomere shortening offers valuable insights into cancer development and progression while aiding in potential advancements in treatment strategies.\nQuestion: Explain the molecular basis for the inefficacy of telomerase inhibitors (e.g., imetelstat) in cancers reliant on the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) mechanism, emphasizing the role of TERT promoter mutations, ALT-specific chromatin remodeling (e.g., ATRX\/DAXX loss, histone H3.3 deposition), and homologous recombination pathways. Then design a combination therapy strategy that concurrently suppresses both telomerase and ALT in tumors with TMM heterogeneity, noting a specfic drug's trial phase where necessary.
