{"problem":"Consider a ratchet, a device shaped like a disk, but with notches around the edge. The ratchet is prevented from rotating backward by a pawl resting against one of the notches. The pawl is held against the notch by a spring. The ratchet can rotate forward. As it does so, it gradually lifts the pawl and compresses the spring. The pawl continues rising and the spring continues compressing until the ratchet has advanced one notch forward, at which point the pawl falls off the edge of the notch, releasing the elastic energy in the spring. The elastic energy in the spring just before the pawl falls of the edge of a notch is \\\\(\\\\epsilon\\\\), and the elastic energy in the spring just after the pawl falls off the edge of a notch is zero.\n\nThe pawl passes to a new notch every time the ratchet rotates forward by some angle \\\\(\\\\theta\\\\). If some influence causes the pawl to rise until the potential energy in the spring is greater than \\\\(\\\\epsilon\\\\), the pawl can rotate backwards.\\\n\\\nThe ratchet is connected to vanes via an axle.

{"problem":"Consider two simple non-interacting pendulums.

To compensate for the mechanical energy loss due to friction in each period, each pendulum receives a kick along its direction of motion once per period, and we assume the kick occurs at `\\( \\theta=- b\/\\omega^{2} \\)` when its angular velocity is positive. Assume that every time a kick is given, an amount of energy equal to `\\( {\\mathfrak{}}mL^{2}h^{2}\/2 \\)` is injected into the pendulum.

{"problem":"An 8 kbp plasmid was extracted from an unknown bacterium using a silica membrane-based approach. For the first characterization of the plasmid, the researcher mixed the extracted plasmid with glycerol and an intercalating dye and proceeded to run electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. The results of the electrophoresis resulted in five distinct bands: one at the 8 kbp mark; one slightly higher; one very high but faint band; and another two separate bands significantly lower, with the higher of these two being the brightest of the five total bands. Using Southern blots and a known 40-mer sequence, the researcher concluded that all five bands came from the plasmid. The researcher also performed absorbance experiments and found that the lowest band absorbed almost twice as much 260 nm light as the other bands.

{"problem":"Molecular cloning is a technique that enables the generation of recombinant plasmids that can induce exogenous expression of certain genes. The first step of molecular cloning is to reverse transcribe the mRNA of the gene of interest into single-stranded cDNA. In an experiment, this was achieved through the use of oligo dT primers that specifically anneal to the poly-A tail of mRNA molecules, which is then extended by reverse transcriptase enzyme. The resultant cDNA molecules are then amplified through PCR and the products were visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis to ensure that the gene of interest was correctly amplified. However, the observed DNA band was estimated to be ~1 kb in size, which is far below the expected 3.7 kb of the gene of interest.

{"problem":"An experiment utilising live *Escherichia coli* (EC) and killed *E. coli* (KEC) bacteria was set up. KECs were generated by treating EC with streptomycin or gentamycin, and both ECs and KECs were stored at 4°C prior to use. Firstly, ECs were subjected to stable isotope labelling by amino acids in culture (SILAC) or grown in a culture medium only containing 13C-labelled glucose (13CLG) before being killed to generate SILAC-KECs or 13CLG-KECs, respectively. Both types of KECs were then added to a culture of bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) grown in (A) transwell chambers or (B) 2D cell culture flasks before being analysed via liquid chromatography combined with mass spectrometry (LC-MS). It was found that the SILAC and 13CLG signals were only present in BMDMs grown in 2D cell culture flasks, but not transwell chambers. Additionally, SILAC signal in cell culture flasks was abrogated upon treatment with concanamycin A. These results were also found to be applicable to several other types of both gram positive and gram negative bacteria. Then, BMDMs were stimulated with 13CLGEC or 13CLGKECs until the internalised bacteria had been largely degraded, and metabolomics analysis was performed using LC-MS. It was found that KEC-treated macrophages displayed higher levels of glutathione, glutathione disulfide and increased levels of itaconate production than the EC-treated macrophages. BMDMs were then cultured in cell culture media deprived of amino acids before being incubated with either 13CLGEC or 13CLGKECs.
